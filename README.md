# LinkCombiner
A simple website for stuffing multiple links into one. It utilizes the # feature of URLs in order to achieve dynamic URLs on an otherwise static webpage without front based routing.

Here's the website: https://randomgamingdev.github.io/LinkCombiner/

Basically, the URL parsers of modern browsersignore everything after the #, which means that we can store practically anything there and then read it using Javascript to achieve what's basically just a dynamic URL. This also means less expensive calculations on the actual server since all of the parsing stuff is being done on the client :D.

Simply enter the URLs (each one on a different line) and then press the button to generate the combined url, which you can then copy about of the alert to use in, for example a bookmark or shortcut!

Also, I was bored so I made a bit of pixel art for the website :D
